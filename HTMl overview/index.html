<!-- Html stands for HYPER TEXT MARK UP LANGUAGE.
HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.

In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.

HTML is the skeleton,
CSS is the skin,
and JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to life.
You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: HTML is the structure of a house, CSS is the interior and exterior decor, and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many other functional features that make the house livable. -->

        <hr>
        HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the
        help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. <br>
        * All HTML tags must enclosed within <> these brackets.But some HTML tags are unclosed tags which is also
            known as <strong>Empty Tag OR Void tag Ex:-image tag "Img tag" "anchor tag" etc...</a></strong> <br>
            *Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.<br>
            * If you have used an open tag <> , then you must use a close tag
                < /> (except some tags (void tags)) <br>

        <hr>
        An element consists of the opening tag, a character, the content, and a closing tag. Some elements are empty
        – that is, they don't have a closing tag but instead have a source or link to content that you want to embed
        on the web page. <br>
        An element is a combination of the opening and closing tag, and then the content between them. <br>
        For the default display and styling purpose in HTML, all the elements are divided into two categories: <br>

        1.Block-level element:~A block-level element always start with new line and takes the full width of web
        page, from left to right. <br>
        2.Inline element :~These elements does not start with new line and take width as per requirement. <br>

        <hr>
        HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are
        the modifier of the HTML element.
        Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.
        Attributes should always be applied with start tag.
        The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.
        The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by W3C that it should be written in
        Lowercase only.
        You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two attributes. <br>
